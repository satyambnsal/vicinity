# Vicinity - Private Location-Based Reviews

Vicinity is sort of a Private Yelp, privacy-focused mobile application that demonstrates the potential of zero-knowledge proofs for location-based services. Users can post anonymous reviews for restaurants, landmarks, and attractions while cryptographically proving they visited the location - all without revealing their identity or exact whereabouts.

## Core Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Location Proofs**: Verify proximity to landmarks without revealing exact user location
- **Anonymous Reviews**: Post genuine reviews while maintaining complete privacy
- **JWT Authentication**: Ensure proofs are generated only from the official Vicinity app
- **Mobile-First ZK Implementation**: Showcases ZK cryptography in the resource-constrained environment of mobile devices

## Technical Details

- **Circuit Complexity**: 68,902 gates ([circuits/vicinity/src/main.nr](circuits/vicinity/src/main.nr))
- **ZK Stack**: Noir 1.0.0-beta.2 with Barretenberg 0.76.4 backend
- **Mobile Integration**: UltraHonk prover with locally cached SRS for efficient mobile proving
- **Location Services**: Uses @react-native-community/geolocation (requires one-time permission)
- **Data Storage**: Supabase for storing anonymous reviews (no user details retained)

## How It Works

1. User selects a landmark to review
2. App captures user's location coordinates and generates a ZK proof of proximity
3. JWT verification ensures the proof was generated by the authorized Vicinity app
4. User submits anonymous review with attached proof
5. Other users can verify the review came from someone who visited the location

## Potential Applications

- **Private Check-ins**: Prove attendance at events without revealing identity
- **Location-Based Access Control**: Grant access to resources based on location without tracking movements
- **Decentralized Travel Logs**: Create verifiable travel histories while preserving privacy
- **Location-Based NFTs**: Mint digital collectibles only at specific locations
- **Geo-Restricted Content**: Access region-restricted content while minimizing data collection
